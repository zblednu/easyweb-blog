            <h2>Host your website for free</h2>
            <p>
                Want your website to be something more than a dead-weight resting on your pc?
                <br>
                In this article you will configure Github Pages to host your blog.
            </p>
            <h3 id="sub-article1">Setting up Github account</h3>
            <p>
                If you don't already have one, go to <a href="https://github.com">https://github.com</a> and create an account.
            </p>
            <p>
                We need a way for your PC to identify itself to your Github. That's what SSH-keys are for.
                <br>
                Run the command below in your terminal: 
                <code>
                    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N "" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 && cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
                </code>
                It generates a pair of public/private keys using some fancy algorithm, places it in your user's home directory
                and prints out the created public key. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Copy the last line of terminal's output (the one that starts with "ssh-ed25519").
                Go to <a href="https://github.com/settings/ssh/new">https://github.com/settings/ssh/new</a> and paste it in the "Key" field.
                Name it however you like, then press "Add SSH Key".
            </p>
            <h3 id="sub-article2">Uploading your website to Github</h3>
            <p>
                Go to <a href="https://github.com/new">https://github.com/new</a> to create a repo for your blog project.
                <div class="warning">
                    <strong>! Make sure the visibility is set to Public</strong>, if you set it to Private other people won't be able you see your website online.
                    <img src="../images/public-private.png">
                </div>
                Then click "Create repository" and copy the ssh link it generated.
                <img src="../images/ssh-link-guide.png">
                Now, back to your terminal, we'll upload your blog to the newly created repository.
                <div class="warning">
                    <strong>! Make sure that file of the landing page for your website is named "index.html"</strong>.
                        Standard behaviour for any web-server is to try to serve "index.html" when no resource is specified in the web request.
                </div>
                <ol>
                    <li>cd into your blog's directory and make it a git directory:</li>
                    <code>
                        cd <i>path-to-your-blog</i>
                        <br>
                        git init
                    </code>
                    <li>Switch branch to main and add your entire project as the first commit:</li>
                    <code>
                        git branch -M main
                        <br>
                        git add .
                        <br>
                        git commit -m "initial commit"
                    </code>
                    <li>Set the path to your GitHub repo and upload files:</li>
                    <code>
                        git remote add origin <i>ssh-path-to-your-github-repo</i>
                        <br>
                        git push -u origin main
                    </code>
                </ol>
                You should be able to see your blog's files uploaded to your GitHub repository.
            </p>
            <h3 id="sub-article3">Configuring Github Pages</h3>
            <p>
                On your repository page:
                <ol>
                    <li>Go to repository "Settings" tab</li>
                    <li>Scroll down to the "Pages" section</li>
                    <li>Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"</li>
                    <li>Select "main" branch and the root folder</li>
                    <li>Click "Save"</li>
                </ol>
                In the end, it should look like so:
                <img src="../images/pages-configured.png">
            </p>
            <p>
                After a short period of time (shouldn't take more than 5 minutes), your site will be live at:
                <br>https://username.github.io/repo-name<br>
                <br>
                Or, simply reload the "Pages" tab and you'll see the link:
                <img src="../images/link-created.png"> 
                <br> 
            </p>
            <p>
                From now on, GitHub will serve the latest content in your repository, so there's no need to reconfigure it every time you make a change to your website.
                <br>
                Just make sure you've pushed your changes, and the file named "index.html" is present.
            </p>
