                    Want your website to be something more than a deadweight resting on your pc?
                    <br>
                    In this article you will configure Github Pages to host your blog.

                <h2>Setting up Github account</h2>
                <p>
                    If you don't already have one, go to <a href="https://github.com">github.com</a> and create an account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We need a way for your PC to identify itself to your Github. That's what SSH-keys are for.
                    <br>
                    Run the command below in your terminal: 
                    <code>
                        ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N "" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 && cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
                    </code>
                    It generates a pair of public/private keys using some fancy algorithm, places it in your user's home directory
                    and prints out the created public key. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Copy the last line of terminal's output (the one that starts with "ssh-ed25519").
                    <br>
                    Go to <a href="https://github.com/settings/ssh/new">github.com/settings/ssh/new</a> and paste it in the "Key" field.
                    Name it however you like, then press "Add SSH Key".
                </p>

                <h2>Uploading your website to Github</h2>
                <p>
                    Go to <a href="https://github.com/new">github.com/new</a> to create a repo for your blog project.
                </p>
                <div class="warning">
                    <strong>! Make sure the visibility is set to Public</strong>, if you set it to Private other people won't be able you see your website online.

                </div>
                <p>
                    Then click "Create repository" and copy the ssh link it generated.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now, back to your terminal, we'll upload your blog to the newly created repository.
                </p>
                <div class="warning">
                    <strong>! Make sure that file of the landing page for your website is named "index.html"</strong>.
                        Standard behaviour for any web-server is to try to serve "index.html" when no resource is specified in the web request.

                    <li>
                        cd into your blog's directory, make it a git directory and set the path to your GitHub:
                        <code>
                            cd <i>path-to-your-blog</i>
                            <br>
                            git init
                            <br>
                            git remote add origin <i>ssh-path-to-your-github-repo</i>
                        </code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Switch branch to main and add your entire project as the first commit:
                        <code>
                            git branch -M main
                            <br>
                            git add .
                            <br>
                            git commit -m "initial commit"
                        </code>
                    </li>
                    <li>Finally, upload the files:
                        <code>
                            git push -u origin main
                        </code>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    You should be able to see your blog's files uploaded to your GitHub repository.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="configuring-github-pages">
                <h2>Configuring Github Pages</h2>
                <p>On your repository page:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Go to repository "Settings" tab</li>
                    <li>Scroll down to the "Pages" section</li>
                    <li>Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"</li>
                    <li>Select "main" branch and the root folder</li>
                    <li>Click "Save"</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    In the end, it should look like so:
                </p>
                <img src="../fig/pages-configured.png" alt="GitHub pages tab fully configured">
                <p>
                    After a short period of time (shouldn't take more than 5 minutes), your site will be live at:
                    <br>username.github.io/repo-name<br>
                    <br>
                    Or, simply reload the "Pages" tab and you'll see the link:
                </p>
                <img src="../fig/link-created.png" alt="GitHub Pages shows a link to a hosted website"> 
                <p>
                    From now on, GitHub will serve the latest content in your repository, so there's no need to reconfigure it every time you make a change to your website.
                    <br>
                    Just make sure you've pushed your changes, and the file named "index.html" is present.
                </p>
