            <h2>Host your website for free</h2>
            <p>
                Want your website to be something more than a dead-weight resting on your pc? Fair enough.
            <br>
                We will use Github-Pages functionality to host our blog.
            </p>

            <h3>Setting up Github account</h3>
            <p>
                If you don't have one, go to <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a> and create an account.
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                We need a way for your pc to identify itself to your Github. That's what SSH-keys are for.

                Run the command below in your terminal: 
                <code>
                    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N "" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub "" && cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
                </code>
                This will generate a pair of private and public key using some fancy algorithm, place it in your user's home directory
                and print out the created public key.
            </p>
            <p>
                Copy the last line of output(the one that starts with 'ssh-ed25519'),
                go to <a href="https://github.com/settings/ssh/new">https://github.com/settings/ssh/new</a> and paste it in the key field.
                <br>
                Name it however you like, then press "Add SSH Key".
            </p>
            <h3>Uploading your website to Github</h3>
                <p>
                    Go to <a href="https://github.com/new">https://github.com/new</a> to create a repo for your blog project.
                    Name it somewhat short, <strong>make sure the visibility is set to Public</strong>, if you set it to Private other people won't be able you see your website online.
                    <img src="../images/public-private.png">
                    Then click create repository and copy the ssh link it generated.
                    <img src="../images/ssh-link-guide.png">

                    Now, back to your terminal, we'll upload your blog to the newly created repository.
                    <ol>
                        <li>cd into your blog's directory and make it a git directory</li>
                        <code>
                            cd <i>path-to-your-blog</i>
                            <br>
                            git init
                        </code>
                        <li>Switch branch to main and add your entire project as the first commit</li>
                        <code>
                            git branch -M main
                            <br>
                            git add .
                            <br>
                            git commit -m "initial commit"
                        </code>
                        <li>Set the pass to your github repo and upload files</li>
                        <code>
                            git remote add origin <i>path to your github repo you copied in step 1</i>
                            <br>
                            git push -u origin main
                        </code>
                    </ol>
                    Now you should be able to see your blog's files uploaded to your github.
                </p>
            <h3>Configuring Github-Pages</h3>
                <p>
                    Then, on your repository page:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Go to your repository's "Settings" tab</li>
                        <li>Scroll down to the "Pages" section.</li>
                        <li>Under "Source", select the "main" branch and the root folder.</li>
                        <li>Click "Save"</li>
                    </ol>

                    Your website will be live in a minute or two at https://username.github.io/repo-name
                    <br> 
                    Neat, right? From now on GitHub will serve the latest version of index.html located in the repository. 
                    So no need to re-configure it every time. Just make sure you've pushed your changes.
                </p>
